# Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn for Sparkify Music Streaming Service
# Requirements: 
The project requires the following Python libraries, which are commonly available through the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML
# Project Overview:
The project's primary goal is to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming service. It encompasses the following key steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: A subset of the full dataset (128MB) is loaded and preprocessed to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify features relevant to predicting churn.

# Feature Engineering: 
New features are engineered from the dataset to enhance the modeling process.

Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes, are employed for churn prediction.

# File Descriptions:
The project includes an exploratory Jupyter notebook and an HTML version of the notebook. Markdown cells are utilized to provide explanations throughout the notebook, documenting the data analysis and modeling process.

# Acknowledgments:
Acknowledgments go to Udacity for providing the project idea and workspace.
