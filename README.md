# Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn for Sparkify Music Streaming Service
# Requirements: 
The project requires the following Python libraries, which are commonly available through the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML
# Project Overview:
The project's primary goal is to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming service. It encompasses the following key steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: A subset of the full dataset (128MB) is loaded and preprocessed to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Extensive exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset and identify features relevant to predicting churn.

# Feature Engineering: 
New features are engineered from the dataset to enhance the modeling process.

Modeling: Various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes, are employed for churn prediction.

# Medium blog
For a detailed exposition of the key insights derived from the project's code, please refer to the Medium Blog post accessible via this [link](https://medium.com/@thienthuan08061999/predicting-customer-churn-with-pyspark-saving-your-business-b3ee69557a3f). The blog post delves into the technical intricacies of the project, providing a comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed. Notably, the Random Forest Classifier emerged as the optimal model based on rigorous evaluation of F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model garnered impressive scores, achieving an F1 and Accuracy rating of 0.88.
